# rock-paper-scissors

A basic rock-paper-scissors game, written in Python 3. There are actually two game versions here:

rps.py - A simple text-based rock-paper-scissors game, with score tracking. Outcome is "random" (using the `random` module).

rps-cheater.py - Same game, but the computer has a 25% chance to "cheat". There's a text-based tell when this happens. The computer will also insult the player, because I found it funny.
